You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available Svelte MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.

# Codebase Memory — Knowledge Graph Tools

Graph tools return precise structural results in ~500 tokens vs ~80K for grep.

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Question                | Tool call                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who calls X?            | `trace_path(direction="inbound")`                       |
| What does X call?       | `trace_path(direction="outbound")`                      |
| Full call context       | `trace_path(direction="both")`                          |
| Find by name pattern    | `search_graph(name_pattern="...")`                      |
| Dead code               | `search_graph(max_degree=0, exclude_entry_points=true)` |
| Cross-service edges     | `query_graph` with Cypher                               |
| Impact of local changes | `detect_changes()`                                      |
| Risk-classified trace   | `trace_path(risk_labels=true)`                          |
| Text search             | `search_code` or Grep                                   |

## Exploration Workflow

1. `list_projects` — check if project is indexed
2. `get_graph_schema` — understand node/edge types
3. `search_graph(label="Function", name_pattern=".*Pattern.*")` — find code
4. `get_code_snippet(qualified_name="project.path.FuncName")` — read source

## Tracing Workflow

1. `search_graph(name_pattern=".*FuncName.*")` — discover exact name
2. `trace_path(function_name="FuncName", direction="both", depth=3)` — trace
3. `detect_changes()` — map git diff to affected symbols

## Quality Analysis

- Dead code: `search_graph(max_degree=0, exclude_entry_points=true)`
- High fan-out: `search_graph(min_degree=10, relationship="CALLS", direction="outbound")`
- High fan-in: `search_graph(min_degree=10, relationship="CALLS", direction="inbound")`

## 14 MCP Tools

`index_repository`, `index_status`, `list_projects`, `delete_project`,
`search_graph`, `search_code`, `trace_path`, `detect_changes`,
`query_graph`, `get_graph_schema`, `get_code_snippet`, `get_architecture`,
`manage_adr`, `ingest_traces`

## Edge Types

CALLS, HTTP_CALLS, ASYNC_CALLS, IMPORTS, DEFINES, DEFINES_METHOD,
HANDLES, IMPLEMENTS, OVERRIDE, USAGE, FILE_CHANGES_WITH,
CONTAINS_FILE, CONTAINS_FOLDER, CONTAINS_PACKAGE

## Cypher Examples (for query_graph)

```
MATCH (a)-[r:HTTP_CALLS]->(b) RETURN a.name, b.name, r.url_path, r.confidence LIMIT 20
MATCH (f:Function) WHERE f.name =~ '.*Handler.*' RETURN f.name, f.file_path
MATCH (a)-[r:CALLS]->(b) WHERE a.name = 'main' RETURN b.name
```

## Gotchas

1. `search_graph(relationship="HTTP_CALLS")` filters nodes by degree — use `query_graph` with Cypher to see actual edges.
2. `query_graph` has a 200-row cap — use `search_graph` with degree filters for counting.
3. `trace_path` needs exact names — use `search_graph(name_pattern=...)` first.
4. `direction="outbound"` misses cross-service callers — use `direction="both"`.
5. Results default to 10 per page — check `has_more` and use `offset`.
